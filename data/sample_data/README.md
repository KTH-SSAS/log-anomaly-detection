# Sample data folder

This folder is meant for hosting small extracts of data (larger than in `test_data/`) used for debugging purposes.

## Populating the data

Read through the instructions in the main `README.md` for how to populate this folder with appropriate data.

Have a look at `log_analyzer/data/log_file_utils.py` if you want to see how this is done in detail.
